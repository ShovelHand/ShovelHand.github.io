				<h1 align='center'>This One Time I Did Some Stuff with Some Dirt</h1>
				<p>What can I possibly say about this build log? If you're into reading about this, you must be at least as
					nerdy as I am, which is a lot. Basically this revolves around some dirt I bought, what I did to process the 
					dirt, and what I ended up using it for. Whoopty freaking doo. Well, it was kind of fascinating to me, and my father-in-law thought it was cool too.
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
				<p>So I'm super into aquarium plants, and after moving out of our tiny apartment to a basement suite where I 
				could have my big tank again, I was stoked to get back into planted aquaria in a big way. If you've ever looked at 
				the cost of commercially available substrate for planted tanks, you know that it is pricey. Mineralized topsoil to the 
				rescue! For the price of some bulk topsoil and a little prep time, you can build a substrate that plants love, and very 
				importantly, will not result in ammonia spikes, which can be a danger if there is lots of organic material in a dirted tank. 
				<p>Much has been written about mineralized topsoil in aquariums, so I'll try not to repeat too much information. However, I 
				am very satisified with the results of this method, and I did want to share my experiences with it. A comprehensive breakdown 
				of the process can be found <a href="http://www.aquaticplantcentral.com/forumapc/library/52554-how-mineralized-soil-substrate-aaron-talbot.html">at Aquatic Plant Central</a>. 
				This process is based on the academic work of <a href="http://scapefu.com/mineralized-soil/">soil scientist Sean Murphy</a>. 
				<p>As a brief summary, topsoil is mineralized by encouraging aerobic bacterial action on it by soaking it, draining off the organic rich water, 
				and letting it dry gradually with lots of surface area. Some of the important reasons to do this are:
				<ul>
					<li>Removing twigs, bits of root, and other organic elements that could cause an ammonia spike if burried in your aquarium substrate</li>
					<li>Letting oxidation and bacterial action reduce organic compounds into mineralized compounds that plants can immediately use</li>
					<li>Keeping those mineralized compounds in a form that is available to your plants' roots, not to the algae in the water column</li>
				</ul>
				I have to say that after about a year of having a densely planted tank with a mineralized topsoil substrate, I am a ardent believer. 
				It is a remarkably hastle free substrate that does not kick up clouds as plants are moved, etc. and the plant growth speaks for itself. 
				<strong>I did not use dolomite or potassium chloride (muriate of potash).</strong> I'm not criticizing it's use, I just didn't add it in. A brief rundown of my 
				tank setup is probably in order as well:
				<ul>
					<li>45 Gallon long tank</li>
					<li>Really cool Current USA Satellite Plus Pro LED lighting fixture. Blew a big portion of my tax return on it, but worth it!</li>
					<li>DIY pop bottle CO2 injection. I have two bottles on their own ladder diffusers to keep the levels fairly constant. When one wans, the other is going strong while it gets recharged.</li>
					<li>Mineralized topsoil substrate (obviously) with quartz gravel and flourite gravel cap on top. A lot of the gravel used was actaully screened out of the soil.</li>
				</ul>

					<p>I started by buying a bucketful of dirt from a landscaping place that is conveniently just down the road
					from where I moved to. In this picture you can see the rocks and twigs that need to be seperated out from the 
					finished product.
				</div>

				<div class="imageContainer">
					<div class='imageBlock'>
						<img src='images/MTS/1618.48.55.jpg'  align='top'/>
					</div>
					<p>The dirt gets soaked in a bucket and the excess water is drained off. Here it is spread out on a tarp for the 
					aerobic bacteria to break down organic compounds. Each time I spread it out to dry I would break it up and flip over clods to speed it up.
					<p>It's some exciting mud, boy I tell you!

					</div>
					<p>Each time it got dry enough, I sifted it through a screen I made by stapling a patio door screen onto a wood frame. 
					My parents had that stuff lying around in their shed, so that helped keep this project cheap.
					<p>I was a little surprised at how nice the gravel that got sifted out was. It was nice quartz gravel just like from an 
					aquarium shop, so it was incorporated into the gravel cap.

					</div>
					<p>After a few iterations of soaking, drying and sifting, you can see that the soil is sandy and grainy in 
					consistency. It's a significant difference from organic rich mud that you get at the start. In this picture the 
					iron rich terracotta clay has been mixed in. It's ready for the aquarium!
					<p>I don't use this bucket to brew beer anymore.

				<div class="imageContainer">

						A cosmedic barrier of gravel is put down along the front and sides so the mud doesn't show.
					</div>
					<div class='imageBlock'>
						<img src='images/MTS/2412.51.28.jpg'  align='top'/>
						The mineralized topsoil is placed down. At this point it's about the consistency of thick cake batter.
					</div>

					<div class='imageBlock'>
						<img src='images/MTS/2412.56.49.jpg'  align='top'/>
						Gravel completely covering the mud.
					</div>
					<div class='imageBlock'>
						<img src='images/MTS/2413.06.10.jpg'  align='top'/>
						All done. I tried to make it a bit slopey and undulate for visual interest.
					</div>

				<div class="imageContainer">
					<div class='imageBlock'>
						<img src='images/MTS/2419.44.53.jpg'  align='top'/>
						I filled the tank slowly to not kick up the sediment. I think it's actually the least cloudy of an initial fill 
					that I have had setting up a tank.
					</div>
					<div class='imageBlock'>
						<img src='images/MTS/2016-06-0714.08.49.jpg'  align='top'/>
						Here it is right after filling is complete. I like to plant a tank with just a tiny bit of water in the bottom as 
						it's easier to keep things tidy this way.
					</div>

				<p>Below is the aquarium after three or four months of setup. As you can see, plants love mineralized topsoil! 
				At the time of writing this, the tank has been up for a little under a year, and it's still going great. The cryptocorynes you 
				can see in the centre have flourished and propagated to the front of the tank, but were starting to show signs of potassium difficiency, so I supplemented with root tabs. Maybe skipping 
				the potash wasn't a good idea, but the potassium difficiency was addressed. Naturally, the faster growing plants have to be trimmed out regularly.
