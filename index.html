				Hi! I started making this page in November 2016 because I have a lot of experience in C++ and other object oriented programming
				languages, but not so much web design experience under my belt. Most of my programmer friends are web dev ninjas,
				and I wanted to show that I can hang. It's an ego thing. While my intention for this site is to showcase some of my technical skills, I will gladly throw
				myself into any hobby that results in some kind of finished product. As such I have some of my art projects (I have a BFA in visual art
				in addition to my more recent computer science degree) and other works up here.</p>
				<p><strong>If you are chiefly interested in my programming experience,
				I invite you to check out my github repository.</strong> You can find the link under "external links" in the top navigation banner.</p>
				<h2>Bio:</h2>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>From Victoria, BC</li>
					<li><strong>BFA in Visual Arts</strong> graduated May, 2007 from the University of Victoria</li>
					<li><strong>BSc in Computer Science</strong> graduated October 2016</li>
					<li>I am father to an amazing little boy, and husband to an amazing woman</li>
				</ul>

				<h1>This site is currently a work in progress, and right now mostly serves as a technical demo. 
				Right now I am strongly leaning towards using a more sophisticated framework for this, either Node.js or Laravel,
				which means migrating to a new host (GitHub only supports static websites). So I am spending more time on learning 
				new skills than developing this site these days.
