		<h1>Have a great Summer!<h1>
		<p>Right now it's looking like the coding club will continue in September!
		<h3>Some stuff to keep you busy over the break</h3>
		<p>While you should not waste both youth and sunshine in front of a computer all day, here are some great resources
		for continuing your coding education at home. Being able to teach yourself is vital life skill, and it's crucial if
		you have aspirations to code professionally one day.
		<p>For those of you who have expressed interest in learning <strong>C++</strong>, google <a href="https://scanlibs.com/beginning-cpp-through-game-programming-4th/">
		<em>Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</em></a>, by Michael Dawson. You can (legally) download it for free, and it is a great introduction to the fundamentals of C++ development.
		<br>Another fantastic resource that you may be familiar with is <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a>. 
		There are step-by-step lessons for a wide variety of programming topics here. Some that I particularly recommend are the
		tutorials on JavaScript and all the ones on HTML, CSS and other fundamental web development technologies. <br>
		I'm sure some of you are very interested in game development, and so I'll also point you to the <a href="https://unity3d.com">Unity3D</a> website.
		 While this is probably a more advanced and difficult option, there is a wealth of tutorials available to get you started with this game engine.<br>
		 Beyond that, I'd say that there are tutorials available for every coding topic  you could possibly imagine. Dive in and try new things. 
		 <br> <strong>All of the options I've listed above are free!</strong>
		
		<h1>Some useful starting points to writing html</h1>
		<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. The "markup language" part is an important distinction;
		HTML is not a programming language like Ruby, it provides instructions for how text and other elements like pictures,
		links, and anything else on the page will be displayed by a browser like Chrome. For some good insight into how HTML works, you could download
		this or any other webpage and open it as a text document to see the markup.
		<h3>Tags</h3>
		Tags are how we tell the browser that opens the HTML document what something is, and how it's displayed. For an
		example, consider the heading "Tags" up above, and the heading "Some useful starting points to writing html".
		To get them to display bigger than this paragraph text, I had to use heading tags, like:<br>
		<div align=middle>&lth3&gt heading text goes between tags&lt/h3&gt</div> (by the way, special trickery is required to get the angle brackets to appear
		on screen instead of being used as a directive to display a heading).
		<p><p>Notice the forward slash "/" in the second &lt/h3&gt tag? Most tags come as a pair, with one being the opening
		(&lttag&gt) and one being the closing (&lt/tag&gt), and the slash means it's a closing tag. It's important because
		tags can be <strong>nested</strong>, meaning that we can have tags within tags, and it's important to be able to keep track 
		of where each pair starts and ends. Consider an example where we want to have two divisions set:
		
		<h4>Example of nested tags</h4>
		<div class="block">
		<div >
		&ltdiv class='firstDiv'&gt <br>
<div class="tab">This text is in the first div<br>
			&ltdiv class='secondDiv'&gt <br>
<div class="tab">	This text falls into both the first and second div classes because neither have been closed yet<br></div>
				&lt/div&gt (closes the second div)<br>
				This text is only in the first div, which hasn't been closed yet<br>
				</div>
		&lt/div&gt<br>
		this text is influenced by neither division. They have both been closed.
		</div>
		</div>
	Confused? don't worry about it too much right now. It will become second nature to you quickly if you continue writing HTML
	
		<h2>Our bare bones HTML web page</h2>
		Alright, we understand tags, and how to close and nest them properly. All of these skills will be used as we make the 
		minimal framework we need for a page. It'll look like this: <p>
		
		<div class="block">
		&lthtml&gt<div class="tab">
		&lthead&gt <div class="tab">
			&lttitle&gt replace this text with the title of your page&lt/title&gt<br>
			(this is also where we usually put a file path to any CSS or JavaScript that we want. We'll skip this.)
		</div>
		&lt/head&gt<br>
		&ltbody&gt<div class="tab">
		Replace this text here with what you want on your page <p>
		This is where most of the work you'll be doing get
		</div>
		&lt/body&gt
		</div>
		&lt/html&gt
		</div>
		<p>
		And presto! We have a webpage! It's pretty boring right now though. We'll set to adding some content, but first let's
		go over what we did.
		<ul>
			<li>When we opened the html tag, we let the browser reading the file know that it was the start of a html document.
			Everything between the tags is part of the document.</li>
			<li>We declared a header, and everything in there is information about the document. 
			We just added the title, but there is other important information that would have to be included for a more sophisticated project</li>
			<li>The body tag is everything that gets presented on screen. It's here that we'll write our text, and define images and links, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1>Stuff I'd like you to add to your webpage</h1>
		Your webpage could just be plain text, but most cool webpages have a bit more. We should add some links, 
		images, and maybe some other stuff like lists. Here's some examples of what you can do.
		<ul>
			<li>you can used <div class='block'>&ltp&gt and &ltbr&gt</div> to start a new paragraph or line. These tags are special in that they 
				don't strictly need end tags</li>
			<li>links are declared by <div class='block'>&lta href="LinkGoesHere"&gtlink text &lt/a&gt<div> <br>
			for example <div class='block'>&lta href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"&gtwikipedia page about html&lt/a&gt </div>
			appears as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">wikipedia page about html</a></li>
			<li>images can be displayed by either pointing to a local file (a file on your computer), or by pointing to 
			an online image. Try something like <br><div class='block'>&ltimg src="http://www.htmldog.com/rAF/htmldog.png"&gt</div><br>
			and see what you get. You can also resize your image by explicitly stating its width or hight. Try
			<br><div class='block'>&ltimg src="http://www.htmldog.com/rAF/htmldog.png" width=100></div><br> to see the difference. Images
			don't need an end tag</li>
			<li>You can combine links and images! Try something like <br>
				<div class='block'>&lta href="http://www.htmldog.com/"&gt&ltimg src="http://www.htmldog.com/rAF/htmldog.png" width=200&gt&lt/a&gt<br></div>
				To get this clickable image <br><a href="http://www.htmldog.com/"><img src="http://www.htmldog.com/rAF/htmldog.png" width=200></a>
			</li>
			<li>
				You can make lists. They can be ordered (numbered) or unordered. For example <br>
				<div class='block'>
				html is <br>&ltol&gt <div class='tab'>
					&ltli&gtFun&lt/li&gt<br>
					&ltli&gtUseful&lt/li&gt<br>
					&ltli&gtDear to my heart&lt/li&gt<br>
					&ltli&gt&lta href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/"&gtCan be learned from this source!&lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt<br>
				</div>
				&lt/ol&gt
				</div><br>
				To get:
				<br>html is <ol>
					<li>Fun</li>
					<li>Useful</li>
					<li>Dear to my heart</li>
					<li><a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/'>Can be learned from this source!</a></li>
				</ol>
				See how we nested a link in a list item? Unordered lists are the same, with &ltul&gt instead of &ltol&gt. <br>
				<br>html is <ul>
					<li>Fun</li>
					<li>Useful</li>
					<li>Dear to my heart</li>
					<li><a href='https://www.w3schools.com/html/'>Can be learned from this source!</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>That's plenty for now</h3>
		Try to think of some theme for your webpage, and make it about that. If you're really into cockatiels, 
		maybe make a page about them, with some images, a list of what they eat, how to care for them, and a few links to 
		other useful resources. <br><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xeDWEaZWiQE/hqdefault.jpg'>
